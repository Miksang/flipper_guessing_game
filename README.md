# flipper_guessing_game
This is a simple version of the online game Akinator/20 Questions
I first saw reddit user EscanorSensi asking if a 20 question style game could be implemented on the flipper and it got me thinking...

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Initially, I didn't think the game could be expanded to the same extent as Akinator or the 20 Questions version of this game. Their databases have over 80,000 answers, something of that scale would overwhelm the limited memory of the flipper. 

To address this, the database file is stored on the external sd card of the flipper, and to increase the lookup speed an index system was implemented.

As of right now, there's only a couple hundred answers (if that). So the index system isn't necessairy, but if this were to be expanded it could help. I think?

If you'd like to expand on this, by all means! Let me know if there's anything i may have forgot to upload.

Enjoy. Or don't.

To Install:

Download the "apps_data" folder and extract the "mind_probe" folder. (this mind_probe folder contain the database.csv and database.idx files)

Drop the extraced "mind_probe" folder inside the apps_data folder on your flippers external memory card.

Download the single "mind_prope.fap" file and drop it in the games folder on the flipper zero. 

That's it.

Disclaimers: 

I'm sure there's still countless bugs, but this is the closest I got to a stable version.

I only tried this with Momentum firmware, so heads up there.  

I have never done any actual coding before in my life. 

I had a huge amount of help with various ai tools.

My first time ever posting anything here. 

I have no idea what i'm doing.
